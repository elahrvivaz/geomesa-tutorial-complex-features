Initial work on complex feature support:

1. Uses geotools 'app-schema' to wrap existing simple feature data stores and return complex features
2. Provides ability to join on two different data stores

Current example joins the 'gdelt' GeoMesa data store with a simple property file data store using
the Actor1Name field.

About app-schema:
    App-schema is a standard geotools/geoserver feature that allows you to map any simple feature
    data store into GML format, defined by an XSD file. These XSDs are known as 'application schemas',
    and there are many standardized ones already defined (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GML_Application_Schemas).
    In addition, user's may define their own GML output format.

    The data store output is defined by a mapping file, which maps the data store feature properties
    to elements in the output. This allows for the creation of complex features from simple features.

Mapping files for geotools app-schema are explained here:
    http://docs.geoserver.org/latest/en/user/data/app-schema/mapping-file.html
Feature chaining is the joining of data from multiple data stores:
    http://docs.geoserver.org/latest/en/user/data/app-schema/feature-chaining.html
Useful diagram on joins:

This example is based on the geoserver tutorial on setting up app-schema, which is found here:
    http://docs.geoserver.org/latest/en/user/data/app-schema/tutorial.html
    http://sourceforge.net/projects/geoserver/files/GeoServer/2.5.1/extensions/geoserver-2.5.1-app-schema-plugin.zip/download

gdelt-gsml-GeologicUnit-mapping.xml - maps the GDELT data store to the GSML GeologicalUnit element.
    imports the next mapping:
ucd-gsml-MappedFeature-mapping.xml - maps a properties data store to the MappedFeature element.

The two files join on:
    gdelt:'Actor1Name' == props:GU_ID

Joins in the mapping files are defined by link elements:
    <sourceExpression>
        <OCQL>Actor1Name</OCQL>
        <linkElement>gsml:MappedFeature</linkElement>
        <linkField>gml:name[2]</linkField>
    </sourceExpression>

Geotools will evaluate the CQL and then try to look up a matching element, which can come from a
different mapping file. From my understanding, each join will be a separate query against the data
store based on that attribute value.
